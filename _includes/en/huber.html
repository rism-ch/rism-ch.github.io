<h3>
    Collection Ferdinand F&uuml;rchtegott Huber (1791-1863)
</h3>
<p>
    The collection of the componist of St-Gallen Ferdinand F&uuml;rchtegott Huber is held at the Canton Library Viadana of St-Gallen. Huber, born in 1791, was the son of the vicar and school rector. He very early left St-Gallen for Stuttgart, where he was for some time trompet player at the Opera orchestra. After his return to Switzerland in 1816, he worked as music teacher and organist in Bern and St-Gallen. During this period, he met in Hofwil bei Bern Gottlieb Jakob Kuhn, author of many folk poems, for which text he composed many pieces. He permanently collected and studied Swiss folk music, and set in the revival of alpenhorn. His most famous <em>Lied</em> is &bdquo;Lueget vo Berg und Tal&ldquo;. Huber also composed instrumental music, including 12 horn trios.

    The Ferdinand F&uuml;rchtegott Huber collection is a very important set of sources for the Swiss music tradition. Le musician of St-Gallen is also included in the composers chosen for the <em>Repertory of 19th century&#x27;s swiss composers</em> project. Even if a handfull of prints and a couple of handwritten copies of works of the composer can be found in other Swiss libraries, in particular at the music library of the monastery in Einsiedeln, the collection regroups almost the complete work of Huber, mostly in autograph manuscripts. The Swiss RISM has been mandated by the Canton Library of St-Gallen to catalogue the collection and make it available to the public.
