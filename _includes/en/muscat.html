<p>
    Muscat is an open-source framework for cataloging music documents (handwritten and printed music scores). The project was initiated in 2002 by the United Kingdom working group of RISM and then developed further by the RISM Switzerland. Since early 2014, Muscat has been developed in collaboration with the RISM Central Office in Frankfurt thanks to the decision of the RISM-UK and the RISM Switzerland to make it open-source.
