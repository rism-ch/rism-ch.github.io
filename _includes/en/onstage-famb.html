<h3>
    OnStage: Freunde Alter Musik Basel
</h3>
<p>
    The present project adds a third collection to the concert program database <a href="http://d-lib.rism-ch.org/onstage/"target="blank">On Stage</a> (in the series <a href="http://rism-ch.org/d-lib.html?locale=en"target="blank">RISM digital library</a>), after the collections of the “Haute Ecole de Musique de Lausanne – Conservatoire de Lausanne (HEMU-CL)” and the “Conservatoire de Musique de Genève”. The association “Freunde Alter Musik Basel” (FAMB) was founded in 1942 by Paul Sacher and his colleagues. The programs and the names of the performers provide a cultural and historical overview of the development of the early music movement. The programs of the first 50 years of FAMB concerts were listed in 1992 in a paper publication (Alte Musik – Konzert und Rezeption, ed. by Veronika Gutmann, Winterthur 1992, pp. 234-352). The online publication of the original documents since the foundation of the FAMB is a contribution to the 75th anniversary of the association in 2017 and will be updated regularly. The publication is a collaborative project between RISM Switzerland and the <a href="http://www.scb-basel.ch/index/112965,?_LANGUAGE=en"target="blank">Association FAMB</a>.

    First, the entire collection is digitized, whereupon the data is indexed and the text is automatically read using OCR technology to enable a full-text search. The homepage guarantees both a clear presentation of the different collections as well as optimal search functionality over the entire corpus
