<h3>(Re-)cataloging in the Burgerbibliothek Bern</h3>

<p>
    RISM Switzerland was in charge of re-cataloging and correcting source descriptions at the Burgerbibliothek Bern that were wrong or too brief in the RISM database. In carrying out this work, the Swiss RISM discovered the existence of interesting historical sources that were not yet cataloged. As the offices of the Burgerbibliothek had been moved to the National Library due to the renovation of the former location, the time was ideal to review the documents and identify the sources still to be cataloged in the RISM database. The RISM database will soon be enriched by the descriptions of these important sources for musicology. In a first step, the Anna Feodorowna collection was cataloged, containing many printed music books cataloged in the RISM series A/I (music printed until 1800). Music sources owned by Caroline Mathilde von Wattenwyl, née Pourtalès (1827–1890), mainly printed sources, have also been entered into the database. Thus, the number of documents from the Burgerbibliothek Bern in the RISM database is currently 357. Further sources will be probably added in 2016.
