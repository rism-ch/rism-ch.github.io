The Swiss RISM records music manuscripts and printed musical sources in Swiss libraries and archives according to international scientific standards. It therefore contributes essentially to the conservation of the cultural assets in music in Switzerland. The inventorized collections are accessible to musical performers as well as to musicological research worldwide via internet. The inventorized collections can also be published in form of printed catalogues.
