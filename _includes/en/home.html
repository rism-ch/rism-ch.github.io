The Swiss RISM records music manuscripts and printed musical sources in Swiss libraries and archives according to international scientific standards. It thus contributes in an essential way to the conservation of cultural assets in music in Switzerland. The inventoried collections are accessible to musical performers as well as to musicological research worldwide via internet. The Swiss RISM also has a leading role in the development of <a href="http://muscat-project.org" target="_blank">Muscat</a>, the web-application of the project designed for the cataloguing and the publication of the sources.
