    Music library of the collegiate church of Beromünster

<p>
    Thanks to the financial support from the Albert Koechlin foundation (Albert Koechlin Stiftung) in Lucerne the music sources of St. Michael in Beromünster were comprehensively cataloged during the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 by the Swiss RISM Office. At the end of the cataloging, 823 music manuscripts from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, 1087 printed music books from the 17th and 18th centuries as well as 3656 printed editions from the 19th century are accessible to musicological research and musical performance. During the inventory process the entire collection was rearranged, shelf-marked and repacked in acid-free materials for conservation.

    The collegiate church of St. Michael in Beromünster is in possession of an extensive collection of musical sources in form of autographs, manuscripts and printed editions. Its music library is one of the most important collections of central Switzerland. This music library shares the fate of the libraries of the Benedictine monasteries of Einsiedeln, Engelberg and St. Andreas in Sarnen: these treasures - collected with a religious motivated approach to art - are returning to the awareness of musicological science and musical performance at an extremely slow pace. The manuscripts of the 19th century are most prominent in this collection of liturgical music: they document in a very impressive way that in the daily life of the canons of St. Michael music of the 17th and 18th centuries was continuously cultivated by several "regens chori" far into the 19th century. The fact that St. Michael in Beromünster is the only active community of canon fathers in the German-speaking part of Switzerland having a library of its own, underlines the importance of this collection.
